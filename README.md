# Neko-Love API V4

- This project is a fork of [Otaku17/Neko-Love](https://github.com/Otaku17/Neko-Love).

## ðŸŒŸ What is this?

This project is a **modern reimplementation of the original Neko-Love API**, which was once hosted at `neko-love.xyz`. It served random anime-style images like "neko", "hug", "kiss", and more â€” often used in Discord bots, anime projects, and other community tools.

The original API was written in Node.js using Koa. This version is a **fresh and solid base built with Rust and the Axum framework**, designed for others to easily clone, customize, and host themselves.

- This version **contains NSFW content.**
